# Prework Studyguide Webpage

## Description


My motivation for the prework project was essentially my desire to better myself by entering this program. I built this project because I needed to lock down the basics of web development. I had not previously had much experience with utilizing github or git. Constantly updating my project through git has given me an understanding of how large projects and apps are worked on by so many people at once. All in all I believe this project was essential to my success in this program and I look forward to building similar projects in the future.
